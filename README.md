Description:  
Regeneration model worked to generate railroad surface by blended each surface and expression defects.  
After the model has learned, It can express the custom defect, like location, size.  
  
Unfortunately, The latest version is on the lab server. And after graduation, I can't access to lab server.  
Therefore, this older version may not work properly.
